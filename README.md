Android Weather App
--------------------------

Weather is an android app that can show real time wether in a chosen city. You are able to save your location on a google map and add it to your favorites tab. 

Here I exercised some of the best practices of android MVVM architecture. I learned some of the main Kotlin language features such as null type safety, high order functions and many others. In the app I implemented some basic network requests, Room pesistence. Obviosly, not everything was built 100% correct in the architecture point of view, but the main goal of this project was to get familiar with the modern android app sructure and all the kotlin features.
